 A snapshot of the IceCube HESE event-level dataset used in this analysis. Each row corresponds to a detected neutrino event, with reconstructed features including energy, directional parameters, reconstruction quality metrics, and topology labels (Track or Shower).

Key observation

The dataset represents real experimental data, not simulations. All machine learning models are therefore constrained by detector effects, reconstruction uncertainty, and intrinsic physical ambiguity.
